## What is Lingo?
Lingo is a Chrome/Chromium extension that replaces text in-browser using rules that you define. In other words, it turns *this*:
![Lingo OFF](/images/demo/csharp_off.png)
Into ***this***:
![Lingo ON](/images/demo/csharp_on.png)

Pretty slick if you ask me 😎😎😎

You know what's even slicker though? **Regular Expressions!** With grouping too!

## Aren't there *DOZENS* of other extensions like this?
***NO**, but probably about a singlular dozen*. What makes Lingo special?
- **Light-weight**: Not a single third party library in use
- **Works entirely in extension window**: See your rules applied to the current page as you add/tweak them
- **Open Source**: Made with ❤️ and always will be

Open to collaboration if anyone wants to contribute an Issue/PR!
